    "## Application of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- few companies and institutions who use Python as their one of the main programming\n",
    "  language: Google, NASA, CERN, WIKIPEDIA\n",
    "- Social news networking site “Reddit” is entirely written in Python.\n",
    "- Python scripts serve as scripting language for web applications.So if you want a web server  gateway interface you can use Python\n",
    "- You may hear about some famous web framework like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, Flask etc.   All are based on Python.\n",
    "- NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib ( Modules of Python) are used in Scientific computing.\n",
    "- SageMath is a mathematical software programmable in Python.\n",
    "- Python has been embedded in many software products as a scripting language like- Abaqus, FreeCAD, Cinema4D,\n",
    "- MotionBuilder, Softimage, GIMP and so many others.\n",
    "- Python has been used in algorithmic trading and Artificial Intelligence.\n",

    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python programming is very simple, elegant, and English like. So it’s very easy to learn and a good programming language to start your IT career.\n",
    "- Python is open source and you are free to extend it and make something beautiful out of it.\n",
    "- Python has vast community support. There are over a million questions on StackOverflow in Python category.\n",
    "- There are tons of free modules and packages to help you in every area of development.\n",
    "- Most of the Machine Learning, Data Science, Graphs, Artificial Intelligence APIs are built on top of Python. So if you want to work in the area of cutting-edge technologies then it’s a great choice for you.\n",
    "- Python is used by almost every major company in the world. So the chances of getting a job are much better if you know Python programming. If you are applying for any Python job, please go through Python Interview Questions.\n",
    "- There are no limitations to Python programming, you can use it in IoT, web applications, game development, cryptography, blockchain, scientific calculations, graphs and many other areas."
